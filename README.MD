# This is a simple note pad app for Android.

##  Main features
Not only does it provide a basic function of recording things you want to take notes of, but it also enables you to record your sound and play it later if you want from the audio list.
One of the most powerful feature is that the SU Note Pad, powered by Tess2 Lib, allows users to take pictures and then recognize words from them.
One of the sweetest things it can do is scan QR code encoding words or share notes using QR images, isn't that cool?

##  Also NOTE 
that to use ocr functions of recognizing English or Chinese words from images, you are supposed to copy required traindata from here:
https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata
to sdcard0/haoOcr/tessdata.

*Good luck!*
